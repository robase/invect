  Self-contained Next.js 15 example with Invect.

---

Mounts the Invect backend as a catch-all API route and the React flow editor as a page — no separate backend needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to see the app. The Invect UI is mounted at `/invect`.

## Vercel Cron

For production Vercel deployments, this example includes a dedicated Invect maintenance route at `/api/invect/cron` plus a `vercel.json` cron entry.

That single Invect cron is used to:

- poll pending batch jobs
- resume flows paused for batch completion
- fail stale flow runs
- execute due Invect cron triggers
