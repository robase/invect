/**
 * Pluggable service adapter interfaces (PR 2/14 from flowlib-hosted/UPSTREAM.md).
 *
 * These interfaces define the seams that allow `createInvect()` users to swap
 * the default implementations of cross-cutting infrastructure services
 * (encryption, event bus, chat sessions, cron, batch polling) for
 * runtime-specific alternatives. The hosted Cloudflare variant uses these to
 * inject DO-backed event buses, KV-backed chat sessions, and no-op
 * schedulers (because Cloudflare Cron Triggers handle scheduling externally).
 *
 * Self-hosted users get the unchanged in-process defaults and never need to
 * touch this surface.
 *
 * Wave 2 PRs (5, 8, 12, 13, 14) will plug concrete adapters into these seams;
 * this file only defines the contracts.

 * `env.QUEUE.send(payload)` so a separate consumer Worker picks the
