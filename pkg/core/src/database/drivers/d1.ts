/**
 * Cloudflare D1 driver implementation.
 *
 * Wraps a `D1Database` binding (provided by the Workers runtime as `env.DB`)
 * in the async `DatabaseDriver` interface. Unlike `better-sqlite3` and
 * `libsql`, D1 has no connection string — the host runtime injects the
 * binding into the request scope. The caller passes that binding directly.
 *
 * Note: `@cloudflare/workers-types` is an *optional* peer dependency. The
 * runtime imports `drizzle-orm/d1` and uses the binding's structural API,
 * so installing the workers types is only necessary for compile-time type
 * checking inside a Workers project.

/**
 * Structural interface for a Cloudflare D1 binding.
 *
 * Mirrors the runtime contract exposed by `@cloudflare/workers-types`'
 * `D1Database`. We keep this structural rather than importing the workers
 * types directly so `@invect/core` can be type-checked in environments
 * (Node-only repos) that haven't installed `@cloudflare/workers-types`.
 *
 * In Workers code, this interface is structurally compatible with the real
 * `D1Database` type — pass `env.DB` and TypeScript accepts it.
