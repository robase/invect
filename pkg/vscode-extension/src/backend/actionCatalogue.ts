/**
 * Runtime resolver for the action catalogue.
 *
 * Two sources:
 *   - **static** — `webview/static-action-catalogue.json`, generated at build
 *     time from `@invect/actions` (see `scripts/build-action-catalogue.ts`).
 *     Imported as a JSON module so it inlines into the host bundle (and the
 *     webview bundle) without any runtime fetch.
 *   - **live** — set by L10's `BackendClient` after a successful `GET /actions`
 *     against a connected backend. Empty until the user connects.
 *
 * `snapshot()` returns the live catalogue if present, otherwise the static
 * fallback. Callers (the `FlowEditorProvider#init` payload, the action picker)
 * read this on every send so connect/disconnect transitions are reflected
 * the next time a webview is opened or refreshed.
