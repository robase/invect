Your embedded Invect MCP server is live at:

\`\`\`
${mcpEndpoint}
\`\`\`

Paste the JSON below into your MCP client's config. The server is
loopback-only — only your machine can reach it.

> ⚠️ The port is random and changes on every extension reload. If your MCP
> client stops responding after a reload, re-run **Invect: Show MCP Config**
> and paste the new URL.

---

## Claude Code

Add to \`~/.claude/settings.json\` (global) or \`.claude/settings.local.json\`
(per-workspace):

\`\`\`json
${config}
\`\`\`

Then restart Claude Code. The Invect tools (list flows, get flow, run,
get run logs, validate, etc.) become available to the assistant.

---

## Cursor

Add to \`~/.cursor/mcp.json\`:

\`\`\`json
${config}
\`\`\`

Cursor picks up MCP changes on chat restart.

---

## Claude Desktop

Open **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**. Add the same block:

\`\`\`json
${config}
\`\`\`

Restart Claude Desktop.

---

## Available tools

Once configured, the assistant can:

- **List flows** in the embedded backend
- **Read flow definitions** (nodes, edges, params)
- **Validate** a flow definition
- **Run a flow** with inputs
- **Read run history + logs** for debugging
- **Inspect node executions** for a given run
- **List available actions** (every \`@invect/actions\` provider + plugin contribution)

The assistant operates against the same in-process SQLite database the
visual editor uses — changes it makes are visible in the canvas.
