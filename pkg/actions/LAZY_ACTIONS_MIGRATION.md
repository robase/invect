# Lazy Action Migration

Tracks which providers have been migrated to the `LazyActionDefinition` pattern
introduced in PR 7 of the [flowlib-hosted upstream
plan](../../../flowlib-hosted/UPSTREAM.md). The goal is to keep edge-runtime
bundles (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Workflows) under their cold-start size
caps by deferring provider-SDK imports until the action actually runs.

## How it works

Each provider exposes two arrays:

- `xxxActions: ActionDefinition[]` — eager (existing). Self-hosted backends
  keep using this through `allProviderActions`.
- `lazyXxxActions: LazyActionDefinition[]` — new. Each entry has an `id` and
  a `load()` thunk; the action's module is only imported on first
  `registry.loadAction(id)` / `registry.executeAction(id)` call.

Edge bundles register `allProviderActionsLazy` instead of
`allProviderActions`. Both can coexist — `register()` always wins over
`registerLazy()` for the same id.

For maximum cold-start savings each migrated provider also exports a
dedicated entry point that contains nothing but the lazy descriptors (no
static imports of the provider's action modules):

```ts
// Pulls only the descriptors — provider SDKs load on-demand via `import()`.
import { lazyGmailActions } from '@invect/actions/gmail/lazy';
import { lazyGithubActions } from '@invect/actions/github/lazy';

registry.registerLazy([...lazyGmailActions, ...lazyGithubActions]);
```

Importing from `@invect/actions` directly will pull both eager and lazy
exports through one chunk; bundlers with strict tree-shaking can still
drop the eager arrays, but the per-provider `*/lazy` subpaths guarantee
the smallest cold-start.

| `github` | `pkg/actions/src/github/lazy.ts` | 20           |
| `gmail`  | `pkg/actions/src/gmail/lazy.ts`  | 5            |
| `slack`  | `pkg/actions/src/slack/lazy.ts`  | 2            |

## Pending (follow-up PRs)

The remaining providers all live under `pkg/actions/src/<provider>/` and
expose an eager `xxxActions` array. Migration is mechanical: add a sibling
`lazy.ts` exporting `lazyXxxActions: LazyActionDefinition[]` whose entries
match the action ids exported from `index.ts`.

Once all providers are migrated, `allProviderActionsLazy` will be a
drop-in replacement for `allProviderActions` for any consumer that doesn't
need eager iteration over the catalogue.
